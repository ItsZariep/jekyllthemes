Ultra-Minimalista is a Jekyll theme that supports **multi-page websites**, and it's no full responsive, 'cause was my first theme.

## Features

* You want to create an "about me" page from a single markdown file and   host it under a custom domain name.
* You want to write blog from markdown file.
* You want something like GitHub's [automatic page generator](https://pages.github.com/) for a non-code repository.
