Lever is a versatile and user-friendly Jekyll theme designed specifically for individuals looking to create a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing bio, personal, or resume-style website. Unlike traditional themes that may demand extensive content creation or long-form blogging, Jekyll Lever simplifies the process, allowing users to achieve an impressive and professional-looking site with minimal content investment.

The themeâ€™s strength lies in its flexibility, enabling users to effortlessly showcase their personal and professional journey through simple notes, project links, or even full-length articles. This makes it an ideal choice for individuals who want a streamlined and visually appealing online presence without the need for extensive writing or content development.

With Jekyll Lever, users can curate their personal brand and highlight key aspects of their career, projects, and interests in a visually cohesive manner. It includes multiple high visibility CTAs so clients can easily contact you.
