Just a little something to jump start your Jekyll powered site.
Purposely kept minimal to make adding your own markup and flare easier.

## Features

* 100% compatible with GitHub Pages.
* Stylesheets built using Sass. Swap fonts and change colors with ease. No need to preprocess `.scss` files, Jekyll does it natively for you.
* YAML data files for easier customization of header and footer links.
* A variety of layouts to choose from to accommodate long form articles, media/photography posts, archive pages, and more.
* Optional support for multiple authors, Disqus comments, social sharing links, Google Analytics, AdSense, and more.

Sass preprocessing and the use of Data Files require Jekyll 2.x
