Uno-dbyll is a simple, clean, responsive and stylist theme for jekyll.

I started this _project as a part of my learning and curiosity. Many thanks to Ä°smail_Demirbilek for his responsive website on Jekyll and providing his blog as a reference.

I would also like to thank Dale-Anthony for the his awesome website as a next-reference.
