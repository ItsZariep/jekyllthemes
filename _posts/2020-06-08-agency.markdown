This is the [Agency Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/agency/) converted to a gem-based Jekyll theme with GitHub Pages support. While this had been done before, ([here](https://github.com/y7kim/agency-jekyll-theme), [here](https://github.com/SotiriosVrachas/jekyll-theme-startbootstrap-agency), and [here](https://github.com/laklau/agency-jekyll-theme/)), these are outdated and have not been updated or maintained for years. I built this theme from the most recent Bootstrap source. I also added a lot of new features that go beyond the original theme's capabilities:

## Features

* GitHub Pages support
* [template repo][template] to get up and running in minutes
* contact form functionality powered by [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
* custom pages
* 404 page
* legal/Privacy Policy page
* Google Analytics support
* Markdown support
* custom images
* logo support (instead of just title text)
* automatically updating copyright years
* custom navigation bar, even without the header image(s)
* customizable footer
* custom accent color and dark/light colors
* horizontal scrolling support for client section

## Installation

There are three ways to install this theme:

1. As a gem-based theme
2. Use the [starter template][template]  (best for GitHub Pages)
3. As a remote theme

### 1. Gem-based Theme Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-agency"
```

Then, replace the contents of your `_config.yml` file with [this](https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme/blob/master/_config.yml).

And then execute:

`$ bundle`

Or, install it yourself as:

`$ gem install jekyll-agency`

### 2. Using the [Starter Template][template]

This is the fastest and easiest way to get up and running on GitHub Pages.
Simply generate your own repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/new?template_name=agency-jekyll-theme-starter&template_owner=raviriley), then replace the sample content with your own and configure for your needs.

### 3. Remote Theme Installation

Replace the contents of your `_config.yml` file with [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme-starter/master/_config.yml) and your `Gemfile` with [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme-starter/master/Gemfile). Then execute:

`$ bundle`

[template]: https://github.com/raviriley/agency-jekyll-theme-starter

### Improvements - Up for Grabs

* multiple language support
* ~~custom background images~~

### Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, clone this repo, then run `bundle install`. To test the theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `https://localhost:4000`. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test the theme's contents. As you make modifications, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
