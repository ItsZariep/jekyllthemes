Much-Worse Jekyll Theme for academic page and blog, is a modified version of Steve Miller's NGVM theme.

I prefer large seriff fonts with minimal coloring and styling. Apart form the typography, color scheme and layout.

## Features

* It allows you to maintain your website as a subdirectory on your university of company domain (e.g. [https://university.edu/department/people/your-website](https://university.edu/department/people/your-website)). Most Jekyll blogs are designed to be hosted at custom domain names.
* Most jekyll themes are blog-centric, or single page websites. This theme lets you create multi-page website with a blog if you want.

Both the above are not seminal achievements in science, but they are useful. This theme also supports site analytics including [Statcounter](https://statcounter.com) and major comment providers for blogs.
