A simple and clean Jekyll theme that's easy to modify and very modular in component and element reuse. The theme works well on mobile devices as well, using bootstrap for much of the heavy lifting.

## Features

This theme uses Disqus for comments and includes Google Analytics support (both are disabled out of the box).
