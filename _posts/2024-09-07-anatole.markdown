Anatole is a minimalistic two-column theme [(even)](#credits) for Jekyll.

## Features

- Two-column layout
- Responsive design
- Syntax highlighting

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-anatole"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-anatole
```

And then execute:

```bash
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```bash
gem install jekyll-theme-anatole
```

## Development

In order to ensure a unique environment for developing the theme, the following steps can be applied:

Clone the repository:

```bash
docker compose create
docker start -ia anatole-container
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
docker exec -it anatole-container bash
```

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

This will build your site and make it available on a local server. You can view your site opening your browser at: `http://localhost:4000`.

Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-anatole.gemspec` accordingly.
