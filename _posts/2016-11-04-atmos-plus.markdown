Atmos Plus, this is the copycat, modified version of atmos.org and collection of my older blog posts that I had in 2013 and newly what i add. All of my posts on meliodus.github.io.

It is automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

Thanks to Corey, Dhrubajyoti and Dan for their awesome work which i followed as references:
