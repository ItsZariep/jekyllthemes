BlackDoc is a two-column black theme with a scrolling sidebar. It's ideal for websites that require a master-detail layout for viewing of content, e.g. documentation, cheatsheets, lyrics, notes, etc.

It's based on [Poole](https://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler, and the [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com) theme.

## Features

In addition to the features of [Poole](https://getpoole.com) and [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com), BlackDoc theme adds the following:

* Scrolling sidebar with a thin scrollbar to allow displaying of   numerous top-level content.
* Elements and classes of the Hyde theme were updated to look great in black background. Check out the demo to see the stylings used in the theme.
