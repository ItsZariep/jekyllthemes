Autumn is a minimalistic, duo-chromatic [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} theme that pairs a prominent headline with two column content.

## Features

- Responsive design
- Dark mode
- Syntax highlighting

## Usage

You'll need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, the `bundler` gem, and [`yarn` or ǹpm`](https://yarnpkg.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} installed on our computer. Autumn provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup - just clone and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Ruby gems
bundle install
# Node modules
yarn
```

Then simply run `yarn start` to start the Jekyll server on port `4000`.

## Options

Autumn includes some customizable options, applied via options in the `_config.yml` file. A standout feature is the dark theme.
Have a look at the `_config.yml` file for all available options.
