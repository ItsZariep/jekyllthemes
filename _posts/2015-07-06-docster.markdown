Simple and easy, that's how we would describe working with docster.

We first created it, when we needed an index file for a theme documentation. jekyll offered collections which made the organization into smaller chunks of documentation optimal. Especially because the collections did not generate outputs for themselves.

This theme was created to generate an organized output. It does not require any plugins, which means you can host on GitHub without much effort.

## Features

* Nice syntax highlighting
* dynamic multi-level navigation
* Sass stylesheets

## Contact

If you run into any trouble or have a request please do so by opening up an issue on the theme's GitHub page.
