Lone Wolf Theme is a simple bootstrap based jekyll theme.
It is infamous for abstracting away the frontend code using [Bootstrap 4][bs4] and [Bootswatch wrappers][bootswatch] to help us focus on the **content** and the **functions**.

Since there is no good boostrap based theme for [jekyll][jekyll] I have created this theme in my free time. To learn both the web development and contribute to open source softwares.

## Features

* Has 4 unique layouts `home`, `page`, `post` and `archive` posts.
* Bootstrap based theme enhanced further with the Bootswatch wrappers.
* Uses animate.css for animations.
* Uses font awesome 5 for icons.
* Optimized for search engines using [Jekyll Seo Tag][jst] gem.
