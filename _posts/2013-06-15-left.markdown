Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for Jekyll.

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was extracted from [zachholman.com](https://zachholman.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, which means it was battle-hardened from years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear words.
