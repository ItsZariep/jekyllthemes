Zebra is a minimal Jekyll theme. The idea of Zebra mainly comes from [https://www.subtraction.com/](https://www.subtraction.com/) of Khoi Vinh.

* Everytime I look at a zebra, I can't figure out whether it's black
* with white stripes or white with black stripes, and that frustrates me.

* Enable Disqus comment.
* Custom code for centered and captioned images.
