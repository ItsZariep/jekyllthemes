## Deployment

### Netlify

Use Netlify to deploy this theme. This theme contains a valid and tested `netlify.toml`

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/jekyll-atlantic-theme){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

### Github Pages

This theme has been tested to work with Github Pages (and Github Project Pages). When using Github Pages you will need to update the `baseurl` in the `_config.yml` otherwise all the css, images and paths will be broken.

For example the site `https://zerostaticthemes.github.io/jekyll-atlantic-them` would have `baseurl: "/jekyll-atlantic-theme/"`
