GridGallery theme, pushes the boundaries of Jekyll. This is a photo blogging theme that allows you to share your images on internet. This theme is a chip of this parent [experiment](https://github.com/codrops/GridGallery){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. There aren't any of such unauthodox themes for Jekyll ('till now). Enjoy!
