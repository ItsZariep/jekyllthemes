[GitBook][gitbook] is an amazing frontend style to present and organize contents (such as book chapters and blogs) on Web. The typical to deploy GitBook at [Github Pages][github-pages] is building HTML files locally and then push to Github repository, usually to the gh-pages branch. It's quite annoying to repeat such workload and make it hard for people do version control via git for when there are generated HTML files to be staged in and out.

This theme brings the Gitbook style to [Jekyll][jekyll], by taking style definition out of generated GitBook site and provided the template for [Jekyll][jekyll] to rendering markdown documents to HTML, thus the whole site can be deployed to Github Pages without generating and uploading HTML bundle every time when there are changes to the original repo. This theme suites for Github pages, as well as other sites that use Jekyll as generate.
