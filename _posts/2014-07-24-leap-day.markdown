## Developing Locally

I've worked hard to make develoment easy. Running `script/bootstrap` will get your gems setup (Jekyll, Sass, Compass, Foreman), then you can get started running `script/server` which will run `jekyll serve && compass --watch` commands via terminal. Open `https://localhost:4000` and make changes to any of the, md, .html or .scss files and compass will compile them for you.

Simply refresh your browser (or use something like livereload) and develop away. Most of the colors and sizing is found in the _variables.scss file.
