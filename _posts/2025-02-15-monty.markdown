Monty is a Jekyll theme inspired by [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.github.io/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. It has just enough styling to make it appealing and different, yet is almost as stripped back as [the Emperor parading in his full monty](https://andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/TheEmperorsNewClothes_e.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Monty is designed for [blogging on GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. It is a simple theme consisting of only a home page and your blog posts. You can [preview the theme here](https://brolun.github.io/jekyll-theme-monty/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

## Installation

To use the Monty theme, add the following to your site's `_config.yaml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: brolun/jekyll-theme-monty
plugins:
    - jekyll-remote-theme
    - jekyll-feed
    - jekyll-seo-tag
```

Optionally, if you would like to preview your site locally, add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
```

## Customizing

### Configuration variables

Monty requires the following variable to be set in your site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
title: [Your site's title]
```

Additionally, you may choose to set the following optional variable:

```yaml
locale: [A locale code; 'en_US' is default]
```

### Front matter variables

Monty is **not** designed for sorting blog posts according to `categories`, `tags`, or other front matter variables.

### Favicon

If you want your site to display a favicon, simply add a `favicon.ico` image to the root folder.

### SEO tag and RSS Feed plugins

Monty uses the Jekyll SEO tag plugin. You can [read about how to further configure the SEO tag plugin here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

Monty also uses the Jekyll Feed plugin. The plugin generates an Atom/RSS feed of your blog posts. You can [read about the Feed plugin here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
