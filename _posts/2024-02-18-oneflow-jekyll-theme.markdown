OneFlow is a Jekyll Theme designed to create stunning, clear and practical modern One-Pager Websites.
It offers lots of features and customization options, so you can easily create a Site that matches your own or your client's wishes for design and structure.  

## Installation

The **vision of this theme** is **simplicity and accessibility**, to easily create stunning websites from scratch.  
Therefore, it's not available as a classic gem-based Jekyll theme, but as a ready-to-use GitHub repository that you just need to fork and clone.
So, get ahead and make a fork of this repository, rename it if you like to suit the name of the site you want to create, locally clone it, and directly start editing!

### How to start a development docker container

To test your website and see all of your changes in real-time without deploying it online, you can easily build your site locally.  

* Make sure you have [Bundler](https://bundler.io/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} installed.
* Open up a terminal, navigate to your local repository, and run `docker compose up`.

Your site will then be visible at `http://0.0.0.0:4000/` in any browser.
