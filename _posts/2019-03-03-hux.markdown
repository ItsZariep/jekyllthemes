## Installation

### Getting Started

1. You will need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Following [Using Jekyll with Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} to fullfill the enviromental requirement.

Required dependencies in the `Gemfile`:

```bash
bundle install
```

Serve the website (`localhost:4000` by default):

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve  # alternatively, npm start
```

### Development (Build From Source)

To modify the theme, you will need [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. There are numbers of tasks you can find in the `Gruntfile.js`, includes minifing JavaScript, compiling `.less` to `.css`, adding banners to keep the Apache 2.0 license intact, watching for changes, etc.

Yes, they were inherited and are extremely old-fashioned. There is no modularization and transpilation, etc.

Critical Jekyll-related code are located in `_include/` and `_layouts/`. Most of them are [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} templates.

This theme uses the default code syntax highlighter of jekyll, [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, which is compatible with Pygments theme so just pick any pygments theme css (e.g. from [here](http://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes/languages/javascript.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and replace the content of `highlight.less`.
