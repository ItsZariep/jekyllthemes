Ockham is a content-first minimalist Jekyll blog theme.

Ockham doesnâ€™t offer a bunch of fancy frills and complicated functions to take away from your focus on writing, but Ockham does offer some basic features, including a hideable sidebar, a light and dark mode that follows the system settings, configurable page navigation and social links, pagination, analytics, a comment system, archive, and more.
