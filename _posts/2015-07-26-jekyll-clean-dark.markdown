Cool dark theme which looks nice on a desktop and on mobile devices.

It was forked from Jekyll Clean theme modified a bit and 'darkified' with inspiration from Carte Noire theme colors. Please feel free to check/use/share/modify this theme.

## Features

It has some preinstalled social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow, LastFm, Instagram). You can easily add more by putting .svg images in a `/css/social` folder.
