## Installation

Sample `_config` file [here](https://github.com/dieghernan/chulapa/blob/master/_config.yml){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

There are three possible ways for installing Chulapa:

### A. Use our Github Template

**Recommended if your are starting from scratch.**

Create a Github account, click [this link](https://github.com/dieghernan/chulapa-101/generate){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and quickstart your site!

### B. Remote theme method

**Recommended if you are migrating a previous site.**

If you prefer not to use the template, you can use the `jekyll-remote-theme` method. Just follow these steps:

1.- Create a new GitHub repository or go to an existing one

2.- Add this line to your `_config.yml`:

``` yaml
remote_theme: dieghernan/chulapa
... more config options
```

3.- Remove other `remote_theme/theme` instances of your `_config.yml` file.

### C. Gem-based method ðŸ’Ž

With Gem-based themes, directories such as the `assets`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` are stored in the theme's gem, hidden from your
immediate view. This allows for easier installation and updating as you don't have to manage any of the theme files.

To install as a Gem-based theme:

1.- Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

``` ruby
gem "chulapa-jekyll"
```

2.- Fetch and update bundled gems by running the following [Bundler](https://bundler.io/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} command:

``` bash
bundle
```

3.- Set the `theme` in your project's Jekyll `_config.yml` file:

``` yaml
theme: chulapa-jekyll
```

To update the theme run `bundle update`.
