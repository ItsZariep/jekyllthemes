Starting from Jekyll's minima theme, I created a simple design according to my taste with pages for a blog, about me and projects.

## Features

- Blog: list view, detail view, pagination
- Projects: list view, detail view, pagination
- Tailwind: Version 3, light/dark toggle
- Pages: about, 404
- Layouts

## Install

1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/bjkawecki/Jekyll-Theme-Bluegreen`
2. Use your preferred node package manager to install from `package.json`
3. Install jekyll and bundler: `gem install jekyll bundler`
4. Install the gems: `bundle install`
5. Use the scripts in `package.json` to build or serve your development application

## Customize

- Paste your preffered woff2 font file in `/assets/fonts/` and change the reference in `/_includes/head.html`
- Edit your Tailwind color palettes in `tailwind.config.js`
- Personalize the values for name, email, description, etc. in `_config.yml`
