Hikari is an open-source [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} theme perfect for bloggers and developers who want the best of both worlds: sharing snippets and stories/pictures of their latest vacation in Tokyo (that's just for the example, you may want to go to Kyoto too).

## Features

* Simple & elegant
* Fluid & responsive
* Lightweight (no JS library has been abused during the development of this theme)
* And packed with syntax highlighting for you coders!
